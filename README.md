The augmented reality system that processes live video, object tracking, object recognition and three dimensional user interfaces.
For AR, solving the registration task is the primary key exercise. Precision requirements are stringent: since AR applications fuse
virtual and real information in 6DOF and in real time, even slight inaccuracies in registration can cause intolerable distortions
in the combined view. Consequently, there are two hard problems for mobile AR: registration must be both very accurate and efficient
in terms of computation and memory usage.
